  simple web application designed to provide daily inspiration through random quotes. The application is built using HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic content generation.

## Live Demo

## Features
- **Random Quotes:** Click the "New Quote" button to receive a new, thought-provoking quote each time.
- **Author Attribution:** Each quote is accompanied by the name of the author, providing context and adding a personal touch.
 
## How It Works
The core logic is implemented in JavaScript, where an array of quotes and their respective authors is defined. Upon clicking the "New Quote" button, a random quote is selected and displayed on the page. The design is enhanced using Bootstrap, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate.
